Global Health Metricswww.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018  1837For both males and females, the top two leading causes 
of global YLDs remained consistent between both time periods, during which the total number of YLDs for each of these causes increased. The third top cause in 2017 was depressive disorders for females and diabetes for males. From 1990 to 2007, for females, the number of YLDs attributable to low back pain increased by 29·8% (95% UI 27·7–31·8) and headache disorders increased by 34·0% (32·8–35·3). From 1990 to 2007, for females, the number of YLDs attributable to depressive disorders increased by 32·2% (29·8–34·4), causing depressive disorders to become the third leading cause in 2007 . The number of YLDs for the three leading causes for females continued to increase from 2007 to 2017, by 17·3% (15·8–18·8) for low back pain, 15·3% (14·4–16·2) for headache disorders, and 14·1% (12·8–15·5) for depressive disorders. From 1990 to 2007, for males, the number of YLDs attributable to the top two leading causes increased by 30·2% (28·1–32·2) for low back pain and 34·1% (32·7–35·4) for headache disorders. From 1990 to 2007, for males, the number of YLDs attributable to diabetes increased by 79·0% (75·8–82·2), causing diabetes to become the third leading cause. The number of YLDs for the three leading causes continued to climb from 2007 to 2017, increasing by 17·8% (16·5–19·3) for low back pain, 15·5% (14·5–16·5) for headache disorders, and 30·1% (24·8–36·1) for diabetes.
Between 1990 and 2007, age-standardised YLD rates 
for females decreased for the three leading causes: low back pain (by 7·6%, 95% UI 6·2 to 8·9), headache disorders (by 0·1%, −0·80 to 0·69), and dietary iron deficiency (by 18·8%, 17·0 to 20·7). Between 1990 and 2007, the YLD rate for depressive disorders decreased by 3·0% (1·6 to 4·5) and became the third leading cause of 
YLDs in females in 2007 due to the simultaneous large decrease in dietary iron deficiency (figure 8A). Between 1990 and 2017, YLD rates for females decreased for low back pain (by 10·1%, 95% UI 8·8 to 11·3), depressive disorders (by 6·0%, 5·0 to 7·1), and dietary iron deficiency (by 30·7%, 27·4 to 33·7), while headache disorders increased by 0·6% (−0·19 to 1·42). Between 1990 and 2007, the YLD rates for males decreased for low back pain (6·8%, 5·6 to 7·8) and dietary iron deficiency (15·1%, 10·9 to 18·9), and increased for headache disorders (1·1%, 0·15 to 1·9). Between 1990 and 2007, the YLD rate for diabetes increased by 21·9% (20·0 to 24·0) and became the third leading cause of YLDs in males in 2007 . From 2007 to 2017, the YLD rate for headache disorders increased by 1·5% (0·8 to 2·3) and that for diabetes increased by 4·2% (0·0 to 8·7), whereas the YLD rate for low back pain decreased by 1·3% (0·7 to 1·9). Between 1990 and 2017, the YLD rate for low back pain decreased by 8·0% (6·9  to 9·1) and 
that for dietary iron deficiency decreased by 26·7% (20·6 to 32·5), whereas the rates for headache disorders and diabetes increased by 2·6% (1·6–3·6) and 27·0% (22·2–32·4), respectively.Discussion
Main findings
While age-standardised all-cause global YLD rates decreased by less than 4% over the nearly three-decade period from 1990 to 2017, the number of total YLDs has increased by more than 50% during this time. This pattern is concerning given the lack of substantial improvement in age-standardised rates over time as well as the increased magnitude of total health loss. These patterns are probably related to population growth and ageing as well as increasing numbers of YLDs from conditions such as type 2 diabetes and opioid use disorders, which were less common in 1990. YLD increases, even when age-standardised rates are slightly improving, might pose a burden to economies and health-care systems that have not expanded proportionally to population growth or in populations where economic improvements have not been equitably distributed.
Globally, over the 28-year period studied, three chronic 
NCDs (low back pain, headache disorders, and depressive disorders) have prevailed as three of the top four leading causes of YLDs, collectively causing 162 million (95% UI 118–216) YLDs in 2017 and representing nearly one in 
five YLDs globally. This substantial portion of global YLDs might be amenable to treatment and care access, because headache disorders and depressive disorders can be treated with low-cost therapeutics. The persistence of depressive disorders and low back pain is also concerning given the former’s relation with self-harm and the latter’s relation with potential loss of functional status in the work force.
Emerging trends
For the first time in the GBD study, we estimated the burdens of type 1 and type 2 diabetes separately. Our estimates illustrate the emergence of diabetes as a leading cause of disability globally, ranking as the fourth leading cause of age-standardised YLDs in 2017 . This increased burden was observed across all levels of development. Age-standardised YLDs increased for both females and males across all SDI quintiles between 1990 and 2017 (figure 3). Diabetes poses complicated care challenges even in areas with reliable access to medical services. Preventive measures such as pre
 diabetes screening, 
lifestyle modification, and treatment with low-cost medications such as metformin could avert worsening incidence rates, but as prevalence increases, health-care
 
systems will also need to provide access to services such as wound care, surgical resources, medications including insulin, care for diabetic retino
 pathy, and increased focus 
on heightened cardiovascular disease risk.
This is also the first year of GBD estimation for non-
alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and cirrhosis and liver cancer caused 
by non-alcoholic steatohepatitis 
(NASH). For cirrhosis and liver cancer caused by NASH, we estimated 892 million (95% UI 859–928) global cases for cirrhosis due to NASH and 97
 400 cases
