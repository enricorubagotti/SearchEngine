Global Health Metricswww.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018  1793153 351 282 outpatient visits over a 10-year period. Overall, 
the study now uses hospital data from 335 country-years, 
outpatient visit data from 45 country-years, and health insurance claims data from 
33 country-years between 
the USA, Taiwan (province of China), and Singapore. These data inform multiple cause models in various ways, mainly by providing incidence and prevalence estimates adjusted for read
 mission, non-primary diag -
nosis, outpatient utilisation, or a combination of the above, but also by estimating parameters such as case fatality rates, remission rates, procedure rates, and distribution of disease subtypes. The supplementary methods provide a more detailed description of how the clinical data adjustments are calculated and how admission and outpatient visit data are processed and utilised (appendix 1 section 2).
In the supplementary methods (appendix 1), we show 
the geographical coverage of non-fatal data, both incidence and prevalence, for GBD 2017 . In addition, we illustrate 
the non-fatal data density and availability for 
GBD 2017 from 1990 to 2017 by GBD region and year for each of the three Level 1 GBD cause groups. The GHDx provides the metadata for all sources used for non-fatal estimation.
Non-fatal disease models
For GBD 2017, we modelled non-fatal disease burden using DisMod-MR 2.1, a meta-analysis tool that uses a compartmental model structure with a series of differential equations that synthesise sparse and hetero
-
geneous epidemiological data for non-fatal disease and injury outcomes. Estimation occurred 
at the five levels of 
the GBD location hierarchy—global, super-regional, regional, national, and subnational—with results of each higher level providing guidance for the analysis at the lower geographical level. Important modelling strategy changes from GBD 2016 to GBD 2017 for specific causes, as well as further details on these causes and their respective models, can be found in the supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Custom models were created if DisMod-MR 2.1 did not 
capture the complexity of the disease or if incidence and prevalence needed to be calculated from other data, or both. Further details of these custom models can be found in the cause-specific methods sections of the supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Prevalence was estimated for nine impairments, 
defined as sequelae of multiple causes for which better data were available to estimate the overall occurrence than for each underlying cause: anaemia, intellec
-
tual disability, epilepsy, hearing loss, vision loss, heart failure, infertility
, pelvic inflammatory disease, and 
Guillain-Barré syndrome. Different methodological app -
roaches were used for each impairment estimation process; these details are described in the supplementary methods (appendix 1 section 4).
Severity distributions and disability weights
Severity splits apply a set of proportions that represent the distribution of cases of a given non-fatal cause by its underlying severities. Severity splits are typically cate
-
gorised as asymptomatic, mild, moderate, and severe. This
