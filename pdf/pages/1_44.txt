Figure 5: Sex differences in global prevalence and YLD rates per 100  000 for 22 Level 2 causes by age, 2017
The figure represents the 
difference in prevalence (A) and YLD rates (B) between males and females as well as the cause composition of those differences for each GBD age group for the Level 2 causes 
of non-fatal burden. GBD=Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries, and Risk Factors Study. YLDs=years lived with disability.
