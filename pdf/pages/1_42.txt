Figure 5A illustrates the differences in global prevalence 
for females and males for 2017 by age group for the 
22 Level 2 GBD causes of non-fatal health loss, calculated
 
as the female-specific estimate subtracted from the male-specific estimate such that causes on the left side of the chart are more prevalent in females while causes on the right side of the chart are more prevalent in males in a given age group. Females experience overall higher prevalence in every age group and the highest age-specific global prevalence differences for female-predominant causes occur between the ages of 20 years and 49 years. From birth to 4 years of age, females have higher prevalence of other NCDs, which continues through all age groups, and of neoplasms than males, whereas neurological disorders are female predominant in all ages, becoming notably evident from age 5–9 years and continuing through
  out all subsequent age groups. Similarly, 
HIV
/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections are female 
predominant in all ages, a trend that becomes evident from age 10–14 years. Although nutritional deficiencies are more prevalent in males in the earliest age groups up to age 9 years, they are more prevalent in females in sub
-
sequent age groups up to age 74 years, at which point they once again become more prevalent in males up to the oldest age group. Females also have higher prevalence of
 
self-harm and interpersonal violence starting from age 1–4 years and continuing until age 84 years, after which 
they become more prevalent in males. Digestive diseases are more prevalent in males in all age groups, whereas unintentional injuries emerge as a male-predominant cause from 5 years of age and remain as such until age 89 years, after which they become female predominant. Transport injuries are male predominant in all age groups starting from age 1–4 years. Respiratory infections and tuberculosis are male pre
 dominant in all ages. Cardio -
vascular diseases are male predominant starting from age 50–54 years, whereas chronic respiratory diseases emerge as a male-predominant cause from age 65–69 years.
Figure 5B shows the sex differences in the global 
burden of YLDs for 2017 by age group for the 22 Level 2 GBD causes of non-fatal health loss. Before age 10–14 years, males have greater YLD rates than females, 
driven largely by higher rates of nutritional deficiencies. From age 10–14 years and older, females have greater overall YLD rates in every age group. Under the age of 1 year, females experience higher YLD rates due to neoplasms and maternal and neonatal disorders, whereas male infants experience higher YLD rates due to nutritional deficiencies and other NCDs. Starting at age 10 years, females experience a higher YLD rate due to other NCDs (until age 50–54 years), musculoskeletal disorders, mental disorders, neurological disorders, and chronic respiratory diseases. Males experience higher YLD rates due to unintentional injuries, transport injuries, and substance use disorders for most of life, although females older than 80 years of age experience a higher rate of unintentional injuries than do males. For self-harm and interpersonal violence, females experience higher rates than males until age 30–34 years, at which point males experience higher YLD rates. Males also experience higher YLD rates from neoplasms, cardio
-
vascular diseases, and other NCDs starting in older age groups (≥60 years), and from digestive diseases from age 25–29 years.
Figure 6 shows the extent to which males and females 
in region–cause combinations have diverged in terms of achieving equal change over time between 1990 and 2017
. 
Each region–cause combination shows which sex has performed better over time either by decreasing more or by increasing less in terms of age-standardised YLD rates. Among the 462 region–cause combinations (excluding any “Global” or “All causes” combinations), females had more favourable outcomes over time for 260 combinations (56·3%), and males had more favourable outcomes for 202 combinations (43·7%). The Z score, that is, the number of SDs from equality, was 0·433 for the mean deviation of female-favourable causes and 0·313 for the mean deviation of male-favourable causes.
Figure 7 shows the leading 20 causes of prevalence 
and YLDs for females and males separately for 1990, 2007, and 2017, with percentage change. In 1990, the most common causes for females were oral dis
-
orders, headache disorders, and 
haemoglobinopathies 
and haemolytic anaemias, whereas for males, the most common causes were oral disorders, headache disorders, and tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis. The number of prevalent cases in the top three leading causes for females increased by 23·1% (95% UI 21·8 to 24·5) for oral disorders, 31·5% (30·2 to 32·8) for headache disorders, and 29·9% (29·6 to 30·1) for haemo
 globino -
pathies and haemolytic anaemias between 1990 and 2007 . Between 2007 and 2017, the number of cases increased further by 13·5% (12·9 to 14·1), 14·5% (13·8 to 15·3), and 13·4% (13·2 to 13·6), respectively (figure 7A). Between 1990 and 2007, for males, the number of prevalent cases of oral disorders increased by 21·6% (20·1 to 23·1), the number of headache disorders increased by 31·3% (29·9 to 32·8), and the number of prevalent cases of tuberculosis including latent tuberculosis infection increased by 26·2% (21·7 to 30·3). Between 2007 and

globally and for GBD regions for Level 1 causes for both sexes combined, 1990–2017Coloured lines are global and region values for YLDs. Each point in a line represents 1 year, starting from 1990 and ending in 2017 . In all regions, SDI has increased over time so progress in SDI is associated with points further to the right and later years for a given region, with a downwards gradient indicating a reduction in YLD rate. The black lines indicate the trajectories for each geography expected on the basis of SDI alone. SDI=Socio-demographic Index. YLDs=years lived with disability.
