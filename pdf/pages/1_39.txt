Global Health Metrics1828  www.thelancet.com   Vol 392   November 10, 2018YLD rates as SDI increased (figure 4). However, there 
were important exceptions to this finding. First, some regions did not follow this trend consistently. Southern sub-Saharan Africa showed an increase in YLD rates for more than a decade before beginning a more precipitous decline coinciding with the apex of the HIV epidemic, whereas regions with a higher baseline SDI have generally experienced minimal changes or increases in age-standardised YLD rates over the past decade despite advances in SDI. We found that trends also varied over time depending on cause. As SDI increased, age-standardised and all-age YLDs improved for CMNN causes in most regions, but this relation was less reliable for NCDs. The NCD pattern also differed markedly between all-age and age-standardised rates for NCDs, with all-age rates increasing as SDI improved with relatively little change over time observed in age-standardised rates. For injuries, some regions initially experienced a declining burden as SDI increased, followed by an increasing burden as SDI continued to increase over time, as seen in Central Europe, for example.
Age-specific and sex-specific patterns in prevalence 
and YLDs
Table 2 shows global age-standardised prevalence for 
females and males for all Level 2 GBD causes as well as the relative difference between the sexes in 1990 and 2017 . In both 1990 and 2017, the cause with the greatest relative difference between sexes was substance use disorders, which had a relative difference of 1·09 (95% UI 1·03–1·15) in 1990, which increased to 1·16 (1·09–1·23) in 2017 . In 1990, 302 million (226–388) YLDs were in females and 260 million (195–336) were in males. The all-age YLD rate for females was 11
 273·6 (8455·6–14  492·5) per 100  000 and 
the all-age YLD for males was 9571·4 (7160·9–12  356·1) per 
100 000 in 1990. Among the global sum of YLDs, 53·6% 
(53·3–53·9) or 457 million (344–587) YLDs were in females and 46·4% (46·1–46·7) or 396 million (297–510)
 
YLDs were in males. In the subset of causes that occur in both males and females, there were 761 million (565–987) total YLDs, with 53·0% (52·8–53·2) or 444 million (334–571) YLDs in females and 47·0% (46·8–47·2) or 395 million (296–510) YLDs in males. Between 1990 and 2017, all-age YLD rates increased for females and males,
